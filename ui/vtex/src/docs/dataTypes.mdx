# Data Types

By convetion, all serializable data-types in VTex are prefaced with a dollar sign (`$`) and all-uppercase. This convention serves two purposes (1) it signals which handler outputs the serialized type (all the data-handler types are written in all-uppercase, without the dollar sign), and (2) the data type is safe to pass as props.
